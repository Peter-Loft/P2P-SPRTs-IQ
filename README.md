# P2P-SPRTs-IQ

### Personal Animus
This project is an exploration of blockchain technologies through a personal project. Within this repository, I will keep multiple iterations of the project, including dead-ends I encountered and code that may not end up in the outcome. This is first and foremost to practice and develop my skills within the blockchain world. Eventually, I hope to deploy the finished project to several public testnets and perhaps even a mainnet.

### Introduction
Currently, there are many avenues for gamblers to bet against casinos or 'the house' and these market makers take 8% to 20% as fees. Blockchain technology is uniquely positioned to disrupt this industry of high fees by providing security, trust, and availability at a fraction of the cost of traditional gambling market makers. By providing a public peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace, secured with blockchain and smart contract securities, our clients will be able to efficiently maximize their earnings by leveraging our much lower costs.

### Current Status
As this project is still in relative infancy, there is still ongoing research into the best architecture that could be used to support such a goal as ours. Not surprisingly, the fundamental differences rely on the level of decentralization we want the project to attain. Creating a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is rather out of scope currently, so the main focus is creating a secure and updateable smart contract ecosystem which can facilitate anonymous peers betting against each other in a trustless environment, overseen by an impartial guiding entity. The being to become completely decentralized once self-sustaining. 

### Existing Actors
This is already the goal of several different blockchain-based P2P gambling systems, although as of 28/04/2021, none are using smart contracts to secure and facilitate the bets, all are still held and made on their own private networks. They have prioritized creating their own cryptocurrencies with which they give special privileges like reduced gambling fees.
