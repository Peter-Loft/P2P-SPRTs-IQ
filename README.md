### Personal Animus
This project is an exploration of blockchain technologies through a personal project. Within this repository, I will keep multiple iterations of the project, including dead-ends I encountered and code that may not end up in the outcome. This is first and foremost to practice and develop my skills within the blockchain world. Eventually, I hope to deploy the finished project to several public testnets and perhaps even a mainnet.

### Introduction
Currently there are many avenues for gamblers to bet against casinos or 'the house' and these market makers take upwards of eight to ten percent as fees. Blockchain technology is uniquely positioned to disrupt this industry of high fees by providing security, sureity, and availability at a fraction of the cost of traditional gambling market makers. By providing a marketplace, secured with blockchain and smart contract securities, gamblers will be able to efficiently maximize their earnings.
